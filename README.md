# Aven AI Customer Support Bot

This project implements an AI-powered customer support system for Aven, featuring a sophisticated backend that supports both text and voice interactions, tool-calling capabilities, and a scalable data ingestion pipeline.

**[View Project Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TBUtS0c7-bJFf6Ao_GkWYZHK6kai9lotmdDtOjGnXf4/edit?usp=sharing)** - Comprehensive overview of the Aven Support Bot project including architecture, features, and technical implementation.

## Project Overview

The goal is to provide Aven's customers with a seamless support experience through a web application where they can chat with an intelligent AI assistant. The assistant is equipped to answer questions about Aven's products, search the web for up-to-date information, and even schedule meetings with human agents.

This repository contains two backend implementations:
1.  `backend/`: The original reference backend.
2.  `aven-support-backend/`: The new, enhanced MVP backend built with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and direct integration with Vapi's Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**This README focuses on the `aven-support-backend/` implementation.**

## Features

-   **Dual Interaction Modes**: Supports both text-based chat and voice conversations through a unified, intelligent agent framework.
-   **Scalable Data Ingestion**: A Python-based ingestion pipeline (`ingest.py`) scrapes sitemap URLs, processes the content, and stores it as vector embeddings in a Pinecone index for efficient retrieval.
-   **Advanced RAG Pipeline**: Utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to answer user queries based on Aven's knowledge base.
-   **Dynamic Tool-Calling**: The AI agent can use a variety of tools to handle complex requests:
    -   **Knowledge Base Search**: Searches the Pinecone index for Aven-specific information.
    -   **Web Search**: Uses the Serper API to find real-time information when the knowledge base is insufficient.
    -   **Meeting Scheduling**: Interacts with Google Calendar via OAuth 2.0 to check availability and book appointments, sending invites directly to the user's email.
-   **AI-Powered Guardrails**: Implemented via a robust system prompt that keeps the agent on-topic, prevents hallucination, and guides it on proper tool usage.
-   **Vapi Integration**: Leverages Vapi for seamless voice integration, including transcription and voice synthesis.

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
-   **AI & Machine Learning**:
    -   **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
    -   **Embeddings**: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
    -   **Vector Database**: Pinecone
-   **Voice**: Vapi
-   **External APIs**: Serper (Web Search), Google Calendar API
-   **Web Scraping**: Playwright, BeautifulSoup, Readability
-   **Testing**: Pytest

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   Node.js and npm (for the frontend)
-   **Ngrok**: To expose your local backend to the internet, which is required for Vapi webhooks.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vapi-support-bot
```

### 3. Backend Setup (`aven-support-backend`)

#### a. Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
cd aven-support-backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### b. Install Browser Dependencies for Playwright

The ingestion script uses Playwright to scrape web content. Install its necessary browser dependencies:

```bash
playwright install
```

#### c. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file by copying the example file:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Now, open `.env` and fill in the following values:
-   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
-   `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key.
-   `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`: The name of your Pinecone index (e.g., `aven-support-mvp`).
-   `SERPER_API_KEY`: Your Serper API key.
-   `VAPI_API_KEY`: Your Vapi API key.
-   `BACKEND_URL`: Your public-facing URL from ngrok (see step 4).

#### d. Google Calendar OAuth 2.0 Setup

The new backend uses OAuth 2.0 to allow the agent to schedule meetings on your behalf.

1.  **Get Credentials**: Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), create an **OAuth client ID** for a **Desktop app**, and download the `credentials.json` file.
2.  **Place Credentials**: Move the downloaded `credentials.json` file into the `aven-support-backend/` directory.
3.  **Authorize the App**: Run the setup script *once*. This will open a browser window for you to log in and grant permission.

    ```bash
    python setup_google_calendar.py
    ```

    This will create a `token.json` file in the same directory, which stores your authorization. This file is included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed.

### 4. Run Ngrok

Open a new terminal window and start ngrok to expose your local backend server on port 8000.

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL (e.g., `https://<unique-id>.ngrok-free.app`) and paste it as the `BACKEND_URL` in your `.env` file.

### 5. Data Ingestion

Run the ingestion script to populate your Pinecone index with content from Aven's website.

```bash
python ingest.py
```

### 6. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 7. Run the Application

Use the root `start.sh` script to launch both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

```bash
# From the root directory of the project
sh start.sh
```

-   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (and your ngrok URL).
-   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to interact with the Aven support bot.

## Testing

The new backend includes a suite of unit tests for the core tools and API endpoints. To run the tests, use `pytest`:

```bash
# From the root directory of the project
pytest aven-support-backend/tests/
```
